🎵 Spotify Song Prediction using KNN
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a Spotify song will be liked or not liked (or belongs to a certain mood/genre) based on its audio features using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

📂 Dataset Information

Source: Kaggle Spotify Dataset
 (replace with exact link if you used one)

Features:

Danceability

Energy

Loudness

Tempo

Valence

Popularity

etc.

Target Variable: Song category / user preference (e.g., "Hit" vs "Not Hit", or "Liked" vs "Not Liked").

⚙️ Project Workflow (Step by Step)

Data Collection – Import Spotify dataset (CSV / Kaggle / Spotify API).

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, normalize features.

Feature Selection – Choose key audio features for prediction.

Model Training (KNN) – Train KNN classifier on dataset.

Evaluation – Use confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Visualization – Plot graphs for better understanding (confusion matrix heatmap, feature distribution, etc.).

Prediction – Input a new song’s features and predict whether it belongs to a category.

📊 Results

Accuracy: xx%

Precision: xx%

Recall: xx%

F1-Score: xx%

🚀 Future Work

Try other ML models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Neural Networks.

Integrate Spotify API for real-time predictions.

Build a simple web app to recommend songs.
