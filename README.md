# Playlist-Predictor-KNN-for-Spotify
This mini project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether a Spotify song will be liked or not (or belongs to a specific mood/genre) based on its audio features. It demonstrates practical implementation of KNN, including data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix.
